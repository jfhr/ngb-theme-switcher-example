# Angular Bootstrap theme switcher example

This project demonstrates how to implement a theme switcher using Angular, Bootstrap and custom SASS.
There's a full explanation [on my blog](https://jfhr.me/angular-bootstrap-theme-switcher), 
as well as a [demo page](https://jfhr.me/angular-bootstrap-theme-switcher/demo/index.html).

If something isn't working as described, feel free to file an issue :)
